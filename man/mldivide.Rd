\description{
Solve systems of linear equations Ax = B for x
x = `A\\B` solves the system of linear equations A*x = B. 
The matrices A and B must have the same number of rows. 
MATLABÂ® displays a warning message 
* if A is badly scaled or nearly singular, but performs the calculation regardless.
If A is a scalar, then `A\\B` is equivalent to `A.\\B.`
If A is a square n-by-n matrix and B is a matrix with n rows, then x = `A\\B` is a solution to the equation A*x = B, if it exists.
If A is a rectangular m-by-n matrix with m ~= n, and B is a matrix with m rows, then `A\\B` returns a least-squares solution to the system of equations A*x= B.
